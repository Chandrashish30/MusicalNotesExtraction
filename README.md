# Audio Signal Processing Project

This MATLAB script analyzes and recreates musical notes from an audio file. The example uses Beethoven's "FÃ¼r Elise" (slow version), but the script is adaptable for other songs.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - MATLAB installed.
   - MP3 audio file in the same directory as the script (e.g., "FurElise_Slow.mp3").

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - Open MATLAB and navigate to the script directory.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script step by step or all at once.
   - Plots and audio playbacks are included.

## Script Overview

1. **Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load audio, speed it up, and plot the waveform.
   - Analyze a specific window of the song.

2. **Downsampling:**
   - Reduce computational load by downsampling.
   - Plot the original and downsampled signals.

3. **Thresholding for Note Detection:**
   - Apply a moving threshold to identify notes.
   - Plot the original and detected notes.

4. **Frequency Analysis:**
   - Perform FFT on detected notes to find fundamental frequencies.
   - Plot frequency spectra for each note.

5. **Note Playback:**
   - Recreate the song using sine waves for each detected note.
   - Play back the recreated song and display musical notes.

6. **Additional Function:**
   - `FreqToNote` converts frequencies to musical notes.

## Customization

- **Input Audio:**
  - Replace "FurElise_Slow.mp3" with your audio file.
  - Adjust `t1` and `t2` for a specific song portion.

- **Downsampling and Thresholding:**
  - Modify downsampling factor (`m`) for optimization.
  - Adjust thresholding parameters for better note detection.

## Notes

- **Audio Output:**
  - Audio playback is muted by default. Set `mute` to `false` for audio.

- **Results:**
  - May vary depending on input audio quality.

- **Visualization:**
  - Plots visualize original signal, downsampled signal, detected notes, and frequency spectra.
